# Motivation 

On April 12th, Freddie Gray was arrested in West Baltimore for carrying a knife forbidden by law. A week after his arrest, Freddie Gray died. HIs death was attributed to injuries to the spinal cord. Six police officers present at the arrest were then suspended with pay and later had criminal charges filed against them. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner determined that Freddie Gray's death was a result of a "high-energy injury" and that the death was a homicide by omission of care. As details of Freddie Gray's death became more publically known, protests ensued.

Shortly after, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake formally requested that the Department of Justice (DoJ) conduct an investigation of Baltimore's policing practices. The DoJ, after a yearlong investigation, found that the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) had engaged in multiple unconstitutional policing practices. A consent decree between BPD and the DoJ, which mandates a series of restrictions on officers, amongst other things, was approved by a judge on April 7^th^, 2017. (see this arcticle by the [Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-consent-decree-explainer-20180403-story.html)). By then, all officers involved in the arrest had either been acquitted or had charges against them dropped. 

The goal of the consent decree is to ensure that the Baltimore Police Department resolves the unconstitutional policing practices identified by the DoJ investigation. Although court enforceable, its practical impact is still unknown largely because the broad scope of its various components and the underlying complexity of each of those components. An excerpt from page 48 of [the DoJ's report](https://www.justice.gov/crt/file/883296/download) highlights the multiple infractions suspected of the Baltimore Police Department:

In this case study, we will examined whether the consent decree had an impact on arrest patterns. 

The learning objectives include data wrangling, data visualization, regular expressions, and Poisson regression. 

**Michael**: These libraries need to be updated. 

The libraries used in this case study will be:

+ `tidyverse`, for data wranging and summarization, amongst other things, from a number of packages

+ `ggplot2`, for creating beautiful visualizations with ready data

+ `lubridate`, for converting time data into a form that can be used

+ `MASS`, for conducting a negative binomial regression

+ `stringr`, for handling regular expressions, sets of characters that can be understood by computers

+ `kableExtra`, for creating beautiful HTML tables

+ `gridExtra`, for creating plots of plots

+ `cowplot`, for extending ggplot functionality

# What is the data? 

The analysis uses data from two sources:

+ [Open Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/)

+ [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)

Open Baltimore is a web portal with Baltimore-specific data. The portal is city-managed and regularly updated. All arrest data from the Baltimore Police Department used in this analysis is made available on Open Baltimore [here](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Arrests/3i3v-ibrt).

The American Community Survey is an ongoing survey by the US Census Bureau that captures demographic information for the United States and regions within. We will be using age, sex, and race data (tables B01001A and B01001B) for the county "Baltimore city, Maryland." This data is made available by the US Census Bureau [here](https://www.census.gov/data.html). 

# Data import {#data-import}

We start by loading the libraries we will need for this case study.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(kableExtra)
library(cowplot)
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
library(pander)
```

##Arrest Data

We'll import the arrest data first. 


```{r}
BPD_Arrests <- read_csv("BPD_Arrests.csv")
```

Notice the number of parsing failures. `read_csv()` predicts the class of each column when loading data. Sometimes these predictions are difficult for `read_csv` to make when the data has errors and are resultantly error-prone.

Still, these predictions and errors are useful. With `read_csv()`, we can explicitly assign data classes. Having predictions beforehand allows us to identify potential data collection errors. This is particularly useful when a dataset has a very large number of observations. 

The `problems()` function from `read_csv` allows us to retrieve the problems identified when we first loaded our data. We can determine which columns are causing problems (and how many) with the `summary()` function, but not without some minor transformations of the data. 

Let us look at some of the problems in the dataset identified by `read_csv()`. Note that problems not identified by the function may exist and require more direct methods to identify them. 

```{r}
problems(BPD_Arrests)
```

By converting the `tibble` created by `read_csv()` into a dataframe using `as.data.frame`, we can then use the `as. factor()`. This changes the `col` column into a format `as.factor()` can comprehend. After this change has been made, the `summary()` function  can then create a count of parsing problems caused by each column in our original dataframe. 

If we don't do the above transformations, we get an error message.


```{r, error = TRUE}
summary(as.factor(problems(BPD_Arrests)[,"col"]))
```

This is because the the `problems()` function returns output with multiple classes. In some cases, having multiple classes can complicate the way in which functions are applied.

```{r}
class(problems(BPD_Arrests)[,"col"])
```

We can get around this with the `as.data.frame()` function.  

```{r}
summary(as.factor(as.data.frame(problems(BPD_Arrests))[,"col"]))
```

The `Latitude`, `Longitude`, and `Post` columns appear to be causing problems.

Let's look the columns we will be working with.

```{r}
colnames(BPD_Arrests)
```

As you can see, we have some demographic information about the person arrested. We also have some information about the nature of the arrest. Spatial data is also available. 

The object containing our data is currently a `tibble`. The `tibble` class is great for printing data neatly, but otherwise does not provide substantial advantages over the `dataframe` class. To get a peak at our data without any of the special formatting provided by the `tibble` class, we can use the functions `as.data.frame()` and `head()` to print all columns of data for the first several rows.  

```{r}
head(as.data.frame(BPD_Arrests))
```

Now that we know what data we are working with, let's specify the classes of our columns with `read_csv()`. 

We have the option to not read in some of the data while we are specifying the classes with `read_csv()`. This can be done with the `cols_only()` function, which specifies which columns to read in. 

If we run the code below, we get a parsing failure for each row with a date.

```{r}
BPD_Arrests <- read_csv("BPD_Arrests.csv",
                               col_types = cols_only(Age=col_character(),
                                                                          Sex=col_character(),
                                                                          Race=col_character(),
                                                                          ArrestDate=col_date()))
```

This is because `read_csv` cannot read in our date data, `ArrestDate`, in its current form.

For now, let's specify all of the columns we will be using as a `character class`.

Using the `character` class for data allows us to convert columns of our data to the appropriate class afterward without any formatting issues. This is particularly useful when data is not in a form that `read_csv()` can use to specify a particular class like in the case above. While this may add an additional step, it makes our analysis less error-prone.

Let's read in the data using this more conservative approach.

```{r}
BPD_Arrests <- read_csv("BPD_Arrests.csv",
                               col_types = cols_only(Age=col_integer(),
                                                                          Sex=col_character(),
                                                                          Race=col_character(),
                                                                          ArrestDate=col_character()))
```

Let's check if our `tibble` has any problems.

```{r}
length(as.factor(as.data.frame(problems(BPD_Arrests))[,"col"]))
```

#$ Demographia Data

We need population data to work with arrest rates rather than arrest counts.

Let's load the American Community Survey data we will be using for this analysis. Coming from a well-maintained database, the datasets from the American Community Survey follow a strict codebook. To avoid using uninterpretable headers that correspond to codes in the codebook, we will not use the first row to define our header.

[White Population](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_5YR_B01001A&prodType=table)

[Black Population](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_5YR_B01001B&prodType=table)

```{r}
BaltimoreWhitePop14 <- read_csv("ACS_14_5YR_B01001A_with_ann.csv",
                                col_names = FALSE)
length(as.factor(as.data.frame(problems(BaltimoreWhitePop14))[,"col"]))
```

```{r}
BaltimoreWhitePop15 <- read_csv("ACS_15_5YR_B01001A_with_ann.csv",
                                col_names = FALSE)
length(as.factor(as.data.frame(problems(BaltimoreWhitePop15))[,"col"]))
```

```{r}
BaltimoreWhitePop16 <- read_csv("ACS_16_5YR_B01001A_with_ann.csv",
                                col_names = FALSE)
length(as.factor(as.data.frame(problems(BaltimoreWhitePop16))[,"col"]))
```

```{r}
BaltimoreWhitePop17 <- read_csv("ACS_17_5YR_B01001A_with_ann.csv",
                                col_names = FALSE)
length(as.factor(as.data.frame(problems(BaltimoreWhitePop17))[,"col"]))
```

```{r}
BaltimoreBlackPop14 <- read_csv("ACS_14_5YR_B01001B_with_ann.csv",
                                col_names = FALSE)
length(as.factor(as.data.frame(problems(BaltimoreBlackPop14))[,"col"]))
```

```{r}
BaltimoreBlackPop15 <- read_csv("ACS_15_5YR_B01001B_with_ann.csv",
                                col_names = FALSE)
length(as.factor(as.data.frame(problems(BaltimoreBlackPop15))[,"col"]))
```

```{r}
BaltimoreBlackPop16 <- read_csv("ACS_16_5YR_B01001B_with_ann.csv",
                                col_names = FALSE)
length(as.factor(as.data.frame(problems(BaltimoreBlackPop16))[,"col"]))
```

```{r}
BaltimoreBlackPop17 <- read_csv("ACS_17_5YR_B01001B_with_ann.csv",
                                col_names = FALSE)
length(as.factor(as.data.frame(problems(BaltimoreBlackPop17))[,"col"]))
```

`read_csv()` did not recognize any problems while loading the population data. Given that the above population dataframes all follow a standardized format, it should not be of too much concern. This, however, does not mean that they do not require wrangling. We'll see later that the population dataframes, although much cleaner than our arrest dataframes, are not useful in their current state. 

We then look at the dimensions of each dataframe to get a handle on how large and complicated the dataframes are. 

The dataframe for arrests in Baltimore has `r dim(BPD_Arrests)[1]` rows and `r dim(BPD_Arrests)[2]` columns.

```{r}
dim(BPD_Arrests)
```

The dataframes for the Baltimore populations should all be identically formatted. We can confirm this by taking a look at the dimensions for different year/Race combinations.

```{r}
dim(BaltimoreWhitePop14)==dim(BaltimoreWhitePop17)
dim(BaltimoreWhitePop14)==dim(BaltimoreBlackPop17)
```

Let us take a look at how these dataframes look. Applying functions that print output to multiple dataframes can produce a lot of output. We only need to look at one of the dataframes since they are identically formatted. We will use the last dataframe we produced since it would likely be most unlike the first dataframe we produced if there was a systematic error.

```{r}
head(BaltimoreBlackPop17)
```

Now that we know a little bit about our dataframes, we can begin the process of transforming them for our analysis.

# Data wrangling 

Since three dataframes will be used for this analysis, it is important that we identify the role of each before continuing.

Simply put, we will be analyzing temporal trends in arrests while adjusting for the size of subpopulations using an offset. Our final dataframe should therefore have two components:

+ 1.0 Arrest data
    + 1.1 Open Baltimore Arrest Data
+ 2.0 Population data
    + 2.1 White population data
    + 2.2 Black population data

For our poisson regression, we need each of these components to be grouped in such a way that would allow them to be combined to make our final dataframe. 

Let us create a quick workflow.

**Workflow**

-----

We'll begin by making each of the three dataframes more practical to use. Then we'll combine the population datasets to make a population dataframe. Lastly, we'll create a final dataframe by grouping the arrest and population dataframes similarly and then combine the two.

-----

**Making the arrest data more practical**

We'll begin with the arrest data.

**Michael**: **Consider removing this.**

We can get rid of the spatial data.

We need to be careful when doing this, however. We have the `MASS` and `tidyverse` package loaded. `dplyr`, a package within the `tidyverse`, has a function that we can use called `select()`. `MASS` also has a `select()` function. These functions, `dplyr::select()` and `MASS::select()`, although identically named, are different, meaning whichever package we load second will mask the identically named function of the package loaded first. Since we loaded `dplyr` second (by loading `tidyverse`), our `select()` function is that from `dplyr`. A sure way to use the specific function you intend to use is by specifying the package with a prefix of the form `package::function()`. We do this below, although it isn't necessary since `dplyr`(again, from `tidyverse`) was loaded second.
**Michael**: **Consider removing this.^**

We need to know what type of data we are working with to appropriately work with out data.

Rather than use the `class()` function for each individual variable, we can use `lapply()` to apply the `class()` function to all of our columns. This will save us `r length(colnames(BPD_Arrests))-1` lines of code.

```{r}
lapply(BPD_Arrests[,1:length(colnames(BPD_Arrests))],class)
```

It looks like some of our variables are not specified correctly. This makes sense since we read the columns in as character classes. 

Using `as.Date`, let's make sure R recognizes that the data is in month-day-year format.

```{r}
BPD_Arrests$ArrestDate <- as.Date(BPD_Arrests$ArrestDate,"%m/%d/%Y")
```

Now we do the same thing for our other variables, using the appropriate functions to designate appropriate classes for our data.

```{r}
BPD_Arrests$Sex <- as.factor(BPD_Arrests$Sex)
BPD_Arrests$Race <- as.factor(BPD_Arrests$Race)
```

We need to know a bit more about the values in each column before going forward with assigning levels to our factors class columns.

```{r}
lapply(BPD_Arrests[,1:length(colnames(BPD_Arrests))],
       summary)
```

We are now ready to assign levels to our factor class columns. For this analysis, we will only use arrest and population data for the black and white populations in Baltimore. Our dataset still contains information for arrests of people of other races. We need to exclude this data. 

```{r}
BPD_Arrests$Sex <- factor(BPD_Arrests$Sex,
                                 levels = c("F", "M"),
                                 labels=c("Female", "Male"))
BPD_Arrests <- BPD_Arrests[BPD_Arrests$Race=="B"|BPD_Arrests$Race=="W",]
BPD_Arrests$Race <- factor(BPD_Arrests$Race,
                                  levels = c("B", "W"),
                                  labels = c("Black", "White"))
```

Let's look at our dataframe again.

## Final Arrest Dataframe

```{r}
head(BPD_Arrests)
```

We'll group this final dataframe once we know the limitations of our population data. 

**Making the population data more practical**

Sometimes imported dataframes follow a rigorous codified format. This is more than often the case with very well maintained data. Codified dataframes often require a corresponding codebook.

We imported the dataframes without designating headers for this very reason. Census dataframes are often codified and contain a second set of headers for practical use. Although making the dataframe more functional is still possible without this step, importing the data in this way saves us a few steps.

Our arrest data has practical field names and no second set of headers. Our census data has two sets of headers. 

The first rows of the census data we imported are codified while the second rows are practically named. 

```{r}
head(BaltimoreWhitePop14)
```

We will use the second rows of the census data as field names. This will allow different fields to be easily discernable from one another. 
This can be done simply by treating the second row as a list comprised of character class items. 

We'll begin with the white population data for 2014. We only want to work with one dataframe for now. Later we can explore the use of a "custom" function to suit our needs 

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14) <- as.character(BaltimoreWhitePop14[2,])
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14[,1:5])
```

For each column, there is a field name, the original codified row, and the practical row we used to designate our field names. We can remove the original codified row and the second row that we used to create our field names now that they have been created and saved. 

```{r}
BaltimoreWhitePop14 <- BaltimoreWhitePop14[-(1:2),]
```

The census dataframes we imported are grouped by age group and gender. Each estimate has a corresponding margin of error. For this analysis, we will only be using the provided estimates. 

For efficiency, we should discard any data that will not be used in our analysis. We could manually remove one column at a time with multiple lines of code. This would take some time and and may involve some trial and error. 

Instead, we will use `substr` to take our character class field names and identify the fields we will need. 

This takes advantage of a programming concept known as [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression?oldformat=true). Simply put, a sequence of text in the data. 

`substr` searches for a distinct character string, a regular expressions, within a portion of the characters in a string. Below, we search for `Estimate` within the 1^st^ through 8^th^ characters in each field name and then save the columns that meet that criteria. This leaves out the columns beginning with `Margin of Error`. We also save and rename the `Geography` column as good practice. Rownames are removed to avoid later confusion. 

```{r}
Geography <- BaltimoreWhitePop14$Geography
BaltimoreWhitePop14 <- cbind(Geography,
        BaltimoreWhitePop14[, substr(colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14),1,8)=="Estimate"])
rownames(BaltimoreWhitePop14) <- c()
head(BaltimoreWhitePop14[,1:5])
```

Let us look at our new column names.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14)
```

`"Estimate; "` is in nearly every column name in our new dataframe. Let's remove it to have an even more practical dataframe. To do this, we will use `str_remove` from the `stringr` package.

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14) <- str_remove(colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14),"Estimate; ")
```

Our new column names are much simpler.

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14)
```

Let's remove symbols, spaces, and `years` from our field names. The expression `[[:punct:]]` encompasses a wide range of symbols. `str_replace_all` differs from `str_replace` in that it is used to replace patterns for the entire string. A number of resources exist online showing the ways we can use regular expressions (click [here](http://web.mit.edu/hackl/www/lab/turkshop/slides/regex-cheatsheet.pdf) to see this great MIT resource).

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14), "[[:punct:]]", "")
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14), " ", "")
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14), "years", "")
```

Now our column names are practical and concise.

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop14)
```

We need to organize our dataframe to have a single column for age group and a single column gender. This data format is known as *long format* and is required to efficiently create data visualizations with the `ggplot` package. Doing this will also allow us to use more appropriate variables such as age group and gender as well as the specific age group-gender combinations the dataframe currently provides. 

Our dataframe is still a bit messy. It is currently in wide format has two variables of interest in nearly every column. We need to get our dataframe into long format and remove the variable pairings. To do this we will have to collapse the Population data gathered across columns into a single column current combinations and use this column to create a dataframe with age group and gender columns.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14 <- BaltimoreWhitePop14 %>% gather(key=AgeGroupGender,
                                                         value=Population,
                                                         -Geography)
head(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14)
```

Let us remove rows with from `variable` representing totals for each variable. This will simplify the summaries we create later with `dplyr`.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14 <- molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14[molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender!="Total",]
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14 <- molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14[molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender!="Male",]
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14 <- molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14[molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender!="Female",]
```

Now, let us create two empty columns, `AgeGroup` and `Gender`.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroup <- NA
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$Gender <- NA
head(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14)
```

Let us now fill our `AgeGroup` and `Gender` columns with information from our `variable` column. 

To do this we will we will identify patterns within strings and use those specific pattern to fill up our `AgeGroup` and `Gender` columns. This will involve using the `substr()` function along with an ifelse() statement for each of our columns. We will check whether our ifelse() functions worked by combining the `sum()` and `is.na()` functions.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender <- as.character(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender)
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$Gender <- ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender,1,4)=="Male", "Male",
                                          ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender,1,6)=="Female","Female",
                                                 NA
       )
)
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroup <- ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender,1,4)=="Male", str_replace_all(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender,"Male",""),
                                            ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender,1,6)=="Female", str_replace_all(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender,"Female",""),
                                                   NA)
                                            )
head(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14)
```

We can get rid of extraneous fields now that we have the fields we need.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$AgeGroupGender <- NULL
```

Recall leaving the `Geography` column as good practice. Leaving columns specific to a dataframe allow the dataframe to be easily identified from other dataframes after merging. We will be merging this dataframe to the other census dataframe to create a new dataframe with the population demographics we will be adjusting for in our analysis. To help identify which race this dataframe is specific to, we will add a new column, `Race`, with an appropriate factor.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$Race <- as.factor("White")
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14$Year <- as.numeric("2014")
```

Our `Population` variable should be last in our dataframe. `dplyr` could be helpful for this purpose. Let's select/subset the entire dataframe and conveniently reorder our columns. Notice that quotation marks are not necessary after piping with `dplyr`.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14 <- molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14 %>%
  arrange(Geography,
          AgeGroup,
          Gender,
          Race,
          Population,
          Year)
```

Let us take a quick look at our progress thus far.

```{r}
head(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14)
```

For practicality, we will overwrite the prior dataframe. 

```{r}
BaltimoreWhitePop14 <- molten.BaltimoreWhitePop14
```

If our two dataframes are identically formatted, the data wrangling steps we have made up to this point can be repeated to yield a similar dataframe without error.

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop14) <- as.character(unlist(BaltimoreBlackPop14[2,]))
BaltimoreBlackPop14 <- BaltimoreBlackPop14[-(1:2),]
Geography <- BaltimoreBlackPop14$Geography
BaltimoreBlackPop14 <- cbind(Geography,
        BaltimoreBlackPop14[, substr(colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop14),1,8)=="Estimate"])
rownames(BaltimoreBlackPop14) <- c()
colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop14) <- str_remove(colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop14),
                                          "Estimate; ")
colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop14) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop14),
                                               "[[:punct:]]", "")
colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop14) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop14), " ", "")
colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop14) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop14),
                                               "years", "")
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14 <- BaltimoreBlackPop14 %>%
  gather(key=AgeGroupGender,
         value=Population,
         -Geography)
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14 <- molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14[molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender!="Total",]
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14 <- molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14[molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender!="Male",]
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14 <- molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14[molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender!="Female",]
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroup <- NA
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$Gender <- NA
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender <- as.character(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender)
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$Gender <- ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender,1,4)=="Male", "Male",
                                          ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender,1,6)=="Female", "Female",
                                                 NA
       )
)
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroup <- ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender,1,4)=="Male", str_replace_all(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender, "Male", ""),
                                            ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender,1,6)=="Female", str_replace_all(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender,"Female",""),
                                                   NA)
                                            )
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$AgeGroupGender <- NULL
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$Race <- as.factor("Black")
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14$Year <- as.numeric("2014")
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14 <- molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14 %>%
  arrange(Geography,
          AgeGroup,
          Gender,
          Race,
          Population,
          Year)
BaltimoreBlackPop14 <- molten.BaltimoreBlackPop14
head(BaltimoreBlackPop14)
```

As you can see, after repeating the same data wrangling steps, the second dataframe is similarly formatted. 

Now that we've confirmed that our code works across dataframes, we can repeat the successful wrangling steps for the rest of the population datasets efficiently with a function.

To do this, we need to identify areas where the data wrangling code may be different. Given that the population datasets are identically formatted but named differently, our function should be able to complete the wrangling process with a few arguments related to the naming conventions of our dataframes.

Essentially, we use whatever code we applied to one of the two dataframes wrangled above and modify the code to accept the appropriate variations of the dataset we intend to create.

Combining the `paste0()` function with `as.name()` lets us name objects within our function in a way that mirrors the initial wrangling we did without a function. 

Lastly, when creating functions it's important that error messages with relevant information be returned. Our function below takes a dataframe. If a different object class is inserted into our function, it's important that we recognize that with a returned error message. Using `if()` and `stop()` functions allows us to create custom error messages for specific shortfalls we may encounter.

Below is the function to wrangle our data. Aside from the embedded error message capability, use of `paste0` and `as.name()` to create object names, and the use of the `return()` function in place of the `head()` function, the code is identical to the code we used earlier. 

```{r}
ACSdatawrnglr <- 
function(DATAFRAME, RACE, YEAR){
  if(is.data.frame(DATAFRAME)==FALSE){stop("Not a dataframe")}
  colnames(DATAFRAME) <- as.character(unlist(DATAFRAME[2,]))
  DATAFRAME <- DATAFRAME[-(1:2),]
  Geography <- DATAFRAME$Geography
  DATAFRAME <- cbind(Geography,
        DATAFRAME[, substr(colnames(DATAFRAME),1,8)=="Estimate"])
  rownames(DATAFRAME) <- c()
  colnames(DATAFRAME) <- str_remove(colnames(DATAFRAME),
                                          "Estimate; ")
  colnames(DATAFRAME) <- str_replace_all(colnames(DATAFRAME),
                                               "[[:punct:]]", "")
  colnames(DATAFRAME) <- str_replace_all(colnames(DATAFRAME), " ", "")
  colnames(DATAFRAME) <- str_replace_all(colnames(DATAFRAME),
                                               "years", "")
  molten.DATAFRAME <- as.name(paste0("molten.", DATAFRAME))
  molten.DATAFRAME <- DATAFRAME %>%
  gather(key=AgeGroupGender,
         value=Population,
         -Geography)
  molten.DATAFRAME <- molten.DATAFRAME[molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender!="Total",]
  molten.DATAFRAME <- molten.DATAFRAME[molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender!="Male",]
  molten.DATAFRAME <- molten.DATAFRAME[molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender!="Female",]
  molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroup <- NA
  molten.DATAFRAME$Gender <- NA
  molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender <- as.character(molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender)
  molten.DATAFRAME$Gender <- ifelse(substr(molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender,1,4)=="Male", "Male",
                                          ifelse(substr(molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender,1,6)=="Female", "Female",
                                                 NA
       )
)
  molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroup <- ifelse(substr(molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender,1,4)=="Male", str_replace_all(molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender, "Male", ""),
                                            ifelse(substr(molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender,1,6)=="Female", str_replace_all(molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender,"Female",""),
                                                   NA)
                                            )
  molten.DATAFRAME$AgeGroupGender <- NULL
  molten.DATAFRAME$Race <- as.factor(RACE)
  molten.DATAFRAME$Year <- as.numeric(YEAR)
  molten.DATAFRAME <- molten.DATAFRAME %>%
  arrange(Geography,
          AgeGroup,
          Gender,
          Race,
          Population)
  DATAFRAME <- molten.DATAFRAME
  return(DATAFRAME)
}
```

Let's put our `ACSdatawranglr()` function to use. As you can see, we receive an error message if an object that is not a dataframe is entered into our function. 

```{r, error=TRUE}
OCSvector <- as.vector(c("O", "C", "S"))
ABC <- ACSdatawrnglr(OCSvector)
BaltimoreWhitePop15 <- ACSdatawrnglr(BaltimoreWhitePop15, "White", "2015")
BaltimoreWhitePop16 <- ACSdatawrnglr(BaltimoreWhitePop16, "White", "2016")
BaltimoreWhitePop17 <- ACSdatawrnglr(BaltimoreWhitePop17, "White", "2017")
BaltimoreBlackPop15 <- ACSdatawrnglr(BaltimoreBlackPop15, "Black", "2015")
BaltimoreBlackPop16 <- ACSdatawrnglr(BaltimoreBlackPop16, "Black", "2016")
BaltimoreBlackPop17 <- ACSdatawrnglr(BaltimoreBlackPop17, "Black", "2017")
```

Before we continue, we need to ensure that the dataframes we've produced are what we intended. We will take the last dataframe we produced and determine whether the output looks correct.

```{r}
head(BaltimoreBlackPop17[1:5])
```

Let's combine demographic data from the two to create a dataframe from which to base our offset for our regression analysis. We will use `bind_rows` from the `dplyr` package. 

```{r}
demographics <- rbind(BaltimoreWhitePop14,
                      BaltimoreWhitePop15,
                      BaltimoreWhitePop16,
                      BaltimoreWhitePop17,
                      BaltimoreBlackPop14,
                      BaltimoreBlackPop15,
                      BaltimoreBlackPop16,
                      BaltimoreBlackPop17)
head(demographics)
```

Oops! We did some serious wrangling and have not checked our column classes. Let's save some time and apply the `class()` function to all columns of our new dataframe to see whether we inadvertently made some changes along the way that can complicate further wrangling. 

```{r}
lapply(demographics[,1:length(colnames(demographics))],
       class)
```

Our `Gender`, `AgeGroup`, and `Population` columns are incorrectly specificed as `character` classes. `Gender` and `AgeGroup` should each be a `factor`. `Population` should be a `numeric`.

We are about to use `dplyr` and `ggplot` for exploratory data analysis. Now would be a good time to fix this. 

```{r}
demographics[,c("Gender","AgeGroup")] <- lapply(demographics[,c("Gender","AgeGroup")],
                                                       as.factor)

demographics$Population <- as.numeric(demographics$Population)
lapply(demographics[,1:length(colnames(demographics))],
       class)
```

The `head()` function only returns several of the uppermost rows, meaning that we are not be able to assess what happened to our rows after we used the `bind_rows()` function. We loaded the `dplyr` package for data summarization. If our dataframes were bound and specified correctly, we should be able to accurately recreate summaries of the data. Let's use the `group_by`,`summarise()`, and `mutate()` functions to do just that. In 2017, Baltimore was roughly 30% White and 63% Black (see the [US Census Estimates for Baltimore City](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_5YR_B02001&prodType=table)). If we bound and specified our dataframes correctly, we should be able to generate similar figures.

In 2017, about 93% of Baltimore was either White or Black. Let us use that information and compare it to the [US Census Estimates for Baltimore City](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_5YR_B02001&prodType=table).

```{r}
TotalPopulationMultiplier <- (100/93)
demographics %>%
  filter(Year==2017) %>%
  group_by(Race) %>%
  summarise(n=sum(Population)) %>%
  mutate(Percent = n/(sum(n)*(TotalPopulationMultiplier)))
```

Our figures are consistent with those by the census. 

## Final Demographic Dataframe

```{r}
head(demographics)
```

We need to group the arrest and population data similarly so that we can merge information from both dataframes into a single dataframe for analysis. 

To group our dataframes properly, we need to know the ways they are similar and the ways they are different. 

```{r}
colnames(demographics)
colnames(BPD_Arrests)
```

Our dataframes are similar in the following ways: 

+ Both have information by sex or gender. **Insert disclaimer about police department using sex and not gender**

+ Both have information by race. 

+ Both have information pertaining to age. 

+ Both have temporal information.

Our dataframes are different in the following ways: 

+ Our demographic data defines age by categorical groups and not in discrete values (as in the arrest data). 

+ Our demographic data has information for the Black and White population in Baltimore, whereas our arrest data includes arrests of people of other races. 

Before grouping, we need to define age similarly for both dataframes. We need to do this while preserving the temporal information provided by the arrest data. 

Now let's recode the age information provided by the arrest data by the age groups used in the demographic data. 

```{r}
levels(demographics$AgeGroup)
demographics <- demographics[demographics$AgeGroup!="Under5",]
demographics <- demographics[demographics$AgeGroup!="5to9",]
demographics <- demographics[demographics$AgeGroup!="10to14",]
demographics <- demographics[demographics$AgeGroup!="15to17",]
demographics$AgeGroup <- factor(demographics$AgeGroup, levels = c("18and19",
                                                "20to24",
                                                "25to29",
                                                "30to34",
                                                "35to44",
                                                "45to54",
                                                "55to64",
                                                "65to74",
                                                "75to84",
                                                "85andover"),
                       ordered = TRUE)
lapply(demographics, levels)
```

How do our levels compare?

```{r}
lapply(BPD_Arrests, levels)
```

```{r}
BPD_Arrests <- BPD_Arrests[BPD_Arrests$Age>=18,]
BPD_Arrests <- BPD_Arrests[is.na(BPD_Arrests$Age)==FALSE,]
BPD_Arrests$Age <- cut(BPD_Arrests$Age, breaks=c(17,
                                                               19,
                                                               24,
                                                               29,
                                                               34,
                                                               44,
                                                               54,
                                                               64,
                                                               74,
                                                               84,
                                                               Inf),
                              labels=levels(demographics$AgeGroup),
                              ordered_result = TRUE,
                              include.lowest = FALSE)
summary(BPD_Arrests$Age)
```

We need a way to link the arrest year to the population year.

```{r}
BPD_Arrests$Year <- year(BPD_Arrests$ArrestDate)
```

Let's change the names of the `Age` and `Sex` variables.

```{r}
colnames(BPD_Arrests)[colnames(BPD_Arrests)=="Age"] <- c("AgeGroup")
colnames(BPD_Arrests)[colnames(BPD_Arrests)=="Sex"] <- c("Gender")
colnames(BPD_Arrests)
```

[POPULATION PROJECTIONS, W/ LINEAR ASSUMPTION](http://www.sociologydiscussion.com/demography/population-projections/population-projections-meaning-types-and-importance/3058)

We don't have population data for 2018 and 2019. If we assume that the change in the age distribution is constant for the years of interst, we can estimate the counts we need for our analysis. 

```{r}
demographics %>% group_by(Race, Gender, AgeGroup, Year) %>% ggplot(aes(x = AgeGroup, y = Population, fill = Gender)) + 
  geom_bar(data = subset(demographics, Gender == "Female"), stat = "identity") + 
  geom_bar(data = subset(demographics, Gender == "Male"), stat="identity", aes(y=Population*-1)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-40000,40000,20000),labels=seq(-40, 40, 20)) + 
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(Year~.) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Population Pyramid for Baltimore", subtitle = "Minors excluded") +
  ylab("Population (in Thousands)") +
  xlab("Age Group")
```

```{r}
demographics17_19 <- demographics %>%
  group_by(Race, Gender, AgeGroup) %>%
  mutate(Yearly_delta = (subset(Population, Year==2017)-subset(Population, Year==2014))/4) %>%
  filter(Year==2017) %>%
  mutate(projection2018=round(Population + Yearly_delta*1,0), projection2019=round(projection2019=Population + Yearly_delta*2))

demographics18_19 <- demographics17_19 %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  select(Geography, AgeGroup, Gender, Race, projection2018, projection2019) %>%
  gather(key=Year, value = Population,
         -Geography,
         -AgeGroup,
         -Gender,
         -Race) %>%
  mutate(Year=recode(Year, projection2018=2018, projection2019=2019))

demographics <- bind_rows(demographics, demographics18_19)
```

We now have all the population data we need.

```{r}
demographics %>% group_by(Race, Gender, AgeGroup, Year) %>% ggplot(aes(x = AgeGroup, y = Population, fill = Gender)) + 
  geom_bar(data = subset(demographics, Gender == "Female"), stat = "identity") + 
  geom_bar(data = subset(demographics, Gender == "Male"), stat="identity", aes(y=Population*-1)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-40000,40000,20000),labels=seq(-40, 40, 20)) + 
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(Year~.) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Population Pyramid for Baltimore", subtitle = "Minors excluded") +
  ylab("Population (in Thousands)") +
  xlab("Age Group")
```

Now we can group and combine the data.

```{r}
ArrestData <- BPD_Arrests %>%
  group_by_all() %>%
  summarise(Arrests=n())
DemographicData <- demographics %>%
  group_by_at(vars(Gender,
                   AgeGroup,
                   Race,
                   Population,
                   Year))

AnalysisDF <- ArrestData %>% left_join(DemographicData,by=c("Gender","AgeGroup","Race","Year"))
head(AnalysisDF)
```

Because we'll be analyzing temporal data, we should convert our temporal data into various units for analysis. 

```{r}
AnalysisDF <- AnalysisDF %>%
  mutate(ArrestDay = floor_date(ArrestDate,"day"),
                                    ArrestWeekday=weekdays(ArrestDate),
                                    ArrestWeek=floor_date(ArrestDate,"week"),
                                  ArrestMonth=floor_date(ArrestDate,"month"),
                          ArrestQuarter=floor_date(ArrestDate,"quarter"),
                          ArrestSeason=floor_date(ArrestDate,"season"),
                          ArrestYear=floor_date(ArrestDate,"year"))

AnalysisDF$ArrestWeekday <- factor(AnalysisDF$ArrestWeekday,
                                   levels = c("Sunday",
                                              "Monday",
                                              "Tuesday",
                                              "Wednesday",
                                              "Thursday",
                                              "Friday",
                                              "Saturday"),
                                   labels = c("Sun",

                                              "Wed",

                                              "Fri",
                                              "Sat"),
                                   ordered = TRUE)

Let's explore the data! 

# Exploratory data analysis

Let's see if any related historical events coincided with changes in arrests.

Our data is currently grouped by date in `%m/%d/%y` format. Given the number of arrests in our dataset, it's likely that these arrests cover most if not all days in between 2014 and 2018. For visualization purposes, this may offer too high of a resolution to see any patterns that may exist. 

**Visit this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18091721/align-geom-text-to-a-geom-vline-in-ggplot2) document to learn how to implement this more elegantly**

**alpha does not work on geom_point**

```{r, message=FALSE}
AnalysisDF %>% group_by(ArrestDate) %>% mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = ArrestDate, y=n))+
  geom_point(size=0.1)+
  geom_smooth(color="red")+
  xlab('')+
  ylab('Arrests')+
  ggtitle("Arrests/Day in Baltimore")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "vertical")+
  theme_minimal()
```

The death of **Michael** Brown (August of 2014) appears to immediately precede sharp declines in the number of arrests. Interestingly, the death of Freddie Gray (April of 2015) does not appear to correspond to a decrease in daily arrests. 

`geom_smooth` can often oversmooth our data, reducing its variance, meaning we may not be able to see any small scale variation that could be relevant for our analysis. 

We can use `gridExtra` to place all these plots in a single plot. This makes comparisons a bit easier. 

2019 has incomplete data, let's exclude it for now. 

```{r}
day <- AnalysisDF %>%
  filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>%
  group_by(day=ArrestDay) %>% mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=day, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="red")
```

```{r}
week <- AnalysisDF %>%
  filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>%
  group_by(week=ArrestWeek) %>%
  mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=week, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="purple")
```

```{r}
month <- AnalysisDF %>%
  filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>%
  group_by(month=ArrestMonth) %>%
  mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=month, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="green")
```

```{r}
quarter <- AnalysisDF %>%
  filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>%
  group_by(quarter=ArrestQuarter) %>%
  mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=quarter, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="pink")
```

```{r}
season <- AnalysisDF %>%
  filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>%
  group_by(season=ArrestQuarter) %>%
  mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=season, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="blue")
```

```{r}
year <- AnalysisDF %>%
  filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>%
  group_by(year=ArrestYear) %>%
  mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="orange")
```

```{r}
grid.arrange(day,week,month,quarter,season,year,nrow=3,ncol=2,top="Plot 2")
```

It looks like using month units works well for observing large and small scale variation. We will use this unit to explore the data some more temporally. Note that our decision to use this unit is strictly for vizualization purposes and does not necessarily mean that any specific pattern exists for statistical purposes. 

Let's examine arrest counts and rates by group of interest. For now, let's not consider temporality.

```{r}
AnalysisDF %>% group_by_at(vars(Race, Gender, AgeGroup)) %>%
  summarise(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% mutate(Race_=Race,Gender_=Gender,AgeGroup_=AgeGroup) %>%
  unite(Race_Gender_AgeGroup, c("Race","Gender","AgeGroup"), sep = "/") %>%
  mutate(prop=n/sum(n)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=AgeGroup_,y=prop,fill=AgeGroup_)) +
  xlab("Age Group") +
  ylab("Inverse Proportion") +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",width = 0.5) +
  theme(axis.text.x.bottom = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x.bottom = element_blank()) + 
  facet_grid(Race_~Gender_) + 
  ggtitle("Proportion of Population by Subpopulation")
```

Our vizualizations for representing Black or male arrests appear to highlight clear differences in arrest counts by age group. Let us now use rates.

```{r}
AnalysisDF %>%
  group_by(ArrestMonth,Race,Gender,AgeGroup) %>%
  mutate(r=sum(Arrests)/sum(Population)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ArrestMonth, y=r,color=AgeGroup)) +
  geom_line(size=0.25,alpha=1) +
  facet_grid(Gender~Race)
```

**Michael**: This needs to be updated to reflect an update in the data. 

**Michael**: A better explanation of the code and statistics involved would be great.

Note the two signals in one of the younger age groups for white females. This could either be indicative of short term variation we should be aware of of a small number problem. Recall that the small number problem occurs when the numerator for a rate is small and thus small changes in its count could result in very large changes in the corresponding rate. We could check to see if these signals are a result of a small number problem. 

```{r}
SignalDF <- AnalysisDF %>% filter(Year==2015|Year==2016|Year==2017,Gender=="Female",Race=="White",AgeGroup=="20to24") %>% group_by(ArrestMonth,Race,Gender,AgeGroup) %>% mutate(r=Arrests/Population) %>% filter(r>=5e-04) %>% pull(Arrests)
unstable_arrest_counts <- unique(SignalDF) 
length(unstable_arrest_counts)
theoretical_arrests<- 1:10
theoretical_rate <- seq(1,10,by=1)/6744
theoretical_rate_by_arrests <- as.data.frame(cbind(theoretical_arrests,theoretical_rate))
theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate_ratio <- lag(theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate)/theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate
theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate_ratio_inverse <- 1/(lag(theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate)/theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate)
theoretical_rate_by_arrests <- theoretical_rate_by_arrests %>% gather(key=Type,value=Value,theoretical_rate_ratio,theoretical_rate_ratio_inverse,-theoretical_rate,-theoretical_arrests)
theoretical_rate_by_arrests <- theoretical_rate_by_arrests[complete.cases(theoretical_rate_by_arrests)==TRUE,]
ggplot(theoretical_rate_by_arrests,aes(x=theoretical_arrests, y=Value,color=Type))+
  geom_point(size=1)+
  geom_line(size=1)+
  geom_vline(xintercept=unstable_arrest_counts[1],color="black")
```

As you can see, the arrest counts are very low. It is likely that the signal found in the plot we made was just a result of unstable rates.

Weekdays cannot be linearly plotted, meaning we need to examine arrest counts by weekdays separately.

```{r}
AnalysisDF %>%
  group_by(ArrestWeekday,Race,Gender,AgeGroup) %>%
  mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=ArrestWeekday,y=n,fill=AgeGroup)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position = 'dodge') +
  facet_grid(Gender~Race)
```

```{r}
AnalysisDF %>%
  group_by(ArrestWeekday,Race,Gender,AgeGroup) %>%
  mutate(r=Arrests/Population) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ArrestWeekday,y=r,fill=AgeGroup)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position = 'dodge') +
  facet_grid(Gender~Race)
```

Let's check our assumptions about the distribution of the outcome, arrest counts.

```{r}
arrests_n_per_day_hist <- AnalysisDF %>%
  group_by(ArrestDay) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(Arrests))

raw_counts <- arrests_n_per_day_hist %>%
  group_by(n) %>% tally() %>%
  mutate(Distribution="Observed")
colnames(raw_counts) <- c("n","count","Distribution")

seed <- sum(c(which(letters=='o'),
              which(letters=='c'),
              which(letters=='s')))
set.seed(seed)

poisson_sample <- as.data.frame(rpois(length(arrests_n_per_day_hist$n), mean(arrests_n_per_day_hist$n)))
colnames(poisson_sample) <- c("n")

poisson_sample <- poisson_sample %>%
  group_by(n) %>%
  tally() %>%
  mutate(Distribution="Poisson (Sample)")
colnames(poisson_sample) <- c("n","count","Distribution")

nb_sample <- as.data.frame(rnegbin(length(arrests_n_per_day_hist$n), mu=mean(arrests_n_per_day_hist$n), theta =theta.ml(arrests_n_per_day_hist$n, mu=mean(arrests_n_per_day_hist$n, n=length(arrests_n_per_day_hist$n)))))
colnames(nb_sample) <- c("sample_nb")

nb_sample <- nb_sample %>%
  group_by(sample_nb) %>%
  tally() %>%
  mutate(Distribution="Negative Binomial (Sample)") 
colnames(nb_sample) <- c("n","count","Distribution")

dist_df <- as.data.frame(rbind(raw_counts, poisson_sample, nb_sample))
dist_df$Distribution <- factor(dist_df$Distribution, levels = c("Observed", "Poisson (Sample)", "Negative Binomial (Sample)"), ordered = TRUE)

ggplot(data=dist_df,aes(x=n,y=count, color=Distribution)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.5) + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("black", "blue", "red")) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of Arrests Counts per Day") + 
  xlab("Arrests") +
  ylab("Days") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")

sum(arrests_n_per_day_hist$n)
length(BPD_Arrests$ArrestDate)
```

**Michael**: I found [Hadley's take on the warning messages](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble/issues/450). Hadley's response highlights a problem in R that is a result of conservative programming . **How should we proceed with these warning messages.**

```{r}
raw_counts_qntile<- quantile(raw_counts$n, seq(0, 1, by=.001))

poisson_sample_qntile <- quantile(poisson_sample$n, seq(0,1, by=0.001))

nb_sample_qntile <- quantile(nb_sample$n, seq(0,1, by=0.001))

QQdf <- as.data.frame(cbind(raw_counts_qntile,
                            poisson_sample_qntile,
                            nb_sample_qntile))
colnames(QQdf) <- c("Observed","Poisson","NB")

ggplot(data = QQdf, aes(x=Observed, y=Poisson)) +
  geom_line(size=2, color="black") +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0,color="red") + 
  xlim(0,150)+
  ylim(0,150)+
  theme_minimal()+
  ggtitle("Poisson : Observed QQ Plot")
  
ggplot(data = QQdf, aes(x=Observed, y=NB)) +
  geom_line(size=2, color="black") +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0,color="red") + 
  xlim(0,150) +
  ylim(0,150) +
  theme_minimal() +

```

# Data analysis 

**Michael**: Use gridExtra to reduce the length of output in Markdown. This can be done by placing multiple plots on a single plot. 

```{r}
colnames(AnalysisDF)
```

Let's create the linear spline for the approval of the consent decree.

```{r}
AnalysisDF$CD_lin_spline <- (AnalysisDF$ArrestDate - ymd("2017-04-07"))
AnalysisDF$CD_lin_spline[AnalysisDF$CD_lin_spline<0] <- 0
```

How does our temporal data look like? 

Our temporal data is currently a date class, meaning R will recognize it as numeric. This will pose problems, as our model will resultantly try to fit a linear model and thus not account for trends within a certain time unit but attempt to explain an average change per time unit. In order to account for trends, we must create indicator variables for our temporal data. 

`lubridate` has excellent functions for this. A good rule of thumb for properly creating indicator variables from date classes is that the output of a function that extracts values from date classes has to be ready for interpretable categorization with `as.factor`. In other words, the unique values produced during extraction should correspond to the intended categories. 

```{r}
AnalysisDF$ArrestWeek_IV <- as.factor(week(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate))
AnalysisDF$ArrestMonth_IV <- as.factor(month(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate))
AnalysisDF$ArrestQuarter_IV <- as.factor(quarter(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate))
AnalysisDF$ArrestYear_IV <- as.factor(year(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate))
```

Seasons also need to be generated. A good thing to know is that winter starts in December. With that information and `floor_date`, which rounds date class data down to the lowest boundary, we can assign seasons to our temporal data.

```{r}
AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV <- floor_date(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate, "season")
AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV <- months(AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV)
AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV <- as.factor(AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV)
AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV <- factor(AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV, levels = c("March", "June", "September","December"), labels = c("Spring","Summer","Fall","Winter"))
```

```{r}
colnames(AnalysisDF)
```

```{r}
MODELA1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_A <- AIC(MODELA1)
```

```{r}
MODELB1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_B <- AIC(MODELB1)
```

```{r}
MODELC1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday + ArrestQuarter_IV, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_C <- AIC(MODELC1)
```

```{r}
MODELD1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday + ArrestSeason_IV, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_D <- AIC(MODELD1)
```

It appears that our quarter indicator variable better explains within year variation than does that season indicator variable.

```{r}
MODELE1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday + ArrestMonth_IV, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_E <- AIC(MODELE1)
```

It appears that our month indicator variable explains within year variation moreso than our quarter indicator variable.

We will create one last model that will determine whether there is an interaction between our consent decree and race indicator variables.

```{r}
MODELF1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + ArrestDay + ArrestWeekday + ArrestMonth_IV + Race * CD_lin_spline, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_F <- AIC(MODELF1)
```

It seems that we have ran out of covariates to explore. 

Let us review the AIC values for our models. We'll create a table with the `kableExtra` package. 

At the moment, we are not interested in creating a publishable quality table. Still, we would like the table we produce to be readily interpretable. That is, like all other visualization we create, we want it to be interpretable with little to no supplemental information. For the following table, we want to be able to easily identify the model with the lowest AIC value for future reference. 

```{r}
model_names <- c("A",
                 "B",
                 "C",
                 "D",
                 "E",
                 "F")

model_AICs <- c(AIC_A,
                AIC_B,
                AIC_C,
                AIC_D,
                AIC_E,
                AIC_F)

model_AICs <- round(model_AICs, 0)

model_AICs_table<- as.data.frame(cbind(model_names, model_AICs))

colnames(model_AICs_table) <- c("Model","AIC")

sapply(model_AICs_table, class)

model_AICs_table$AIC <- as.numeric(as.character(model_AICs_table$AIC))
```

**Michael**: Insert paragraph about the models here. This should complement the table below. 

```{r}

kable(model_AICs_table) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("bordered","condensed"), full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(which(model_AICs_table$AIC==min(model_AICs_table$AIC)), bold = T, color = "white", background = "black") %>%
  add_header_above(c("AIC Values, Models A-F"=length(colnames(model_AICs_table))))
```

selected model, check for overdispersion

```{r}
chi_squareF = sum(residuals(MODELF1, type = "pearson")^2); degrees_freedomF = MODELF1$df.residual;
p_valueF = 1-pchisq(chi_squareF, degrees_freedomF)
paste0("Pearson goodness of fit = ", round(chi_squareF,2), ", df = ", degrees_freedomF, ", p-value = ", round(p_valueF,10))
```

```{r}
MODELF2 <- glm.nb(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + ArrestDay + ArrestWeekday + ArrestMonth_IV + Race * CD_lin_spline, data=AnalysisDF, offset(log(Population)))
```

```{r}
LRTstat =2 *(logLik(MODELF2) -logLik(MODELF1))
df = 1
pval =1-pchisq(LRTstat, df)
paste0("LRT test statistic = ", round(LRTstat,2), ", df = ", df, ", p-value = ", round(pval,5))
```

It appears that our NB model is more appropriate.

```{r, message=FALSE}
regress_predict <- lm(AnalysisDF$Arrests ~ MODELF2$fitted.values)
summary(regress_predict)
cor(MODELF2$fitted.values, AnalysisDF$Arrests)
```

```{r}
observed_fitted <- as.data.frame(cbind(AnalysisDF$Arrests, MODELF2$fitted.values))

colnames(observed_fitted) <- c("Expected","Modeled")

observed_fitted$perfect_fit <- observed_fitted$Expected

observed_fitted <- observed_fitted %>% rename("Line of Equality"= perfect_fit, "Observed | Model F2"=Modeled) %>% gather(key = "Data", value = "Observed", -Expected)
```


**Michael**: Improve the readability of code and objects below. 

```{R}
MODELF2_fit_plot <- ggplot(observed_fitted, aes(x = Expected, y = Observed, color=Data)) +
  geom_point(alpha=1/100) +
  geom_smooth(size=2) + 
  ggtitle("Fit, Model F2")

top_density_1 <- axis_canvas(MODELF2_fit_plot, axis = "x") +
  geom_density(data=observed_fitted, aes(x=Expected,alpha=0.25)) +
  theme_void()

right_density_1 <- axis_canvas(MODELF2_fit_plot, axis = "y",coord_flip = TRUE) + 
  geom_density(data=observed_fitted, aes(x=Observed,fill=Data,alpha=0.25)) +
  theme_void() + 
  coord_flip()

final_model_fit_1 <- insert_xaxis_grob(MODELF2_fit_plot, top_density_1, position = "top")

final_model_fit_1 <- insert_yaxis_grob(final_model_fit_1, right_density_1, position = "right")

ggdraw(final_model_fit_1)
```

Let's evaluate leverage and influence in our selected model

It appears that our use of a long term linear covariate representing the daily change in the arrest rate is largely affected by the increased number of arrests in 2014. Let us use an indicator variable for yearly change instead and keep the *spline* of the daily change in arrest rate. This will allow for some more flexibility in our model that won't be severely hindered by data for any given year. 

```{r}
MODELG1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + ArrestYear_IV + ArrestWeekday + ArrestMonth_IV + Race * CD_lin_spline, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_G1 <- AIC(MODELG1)
```

```{r}
chi_squareG = sum(residuals(MODELG1, type = "pearson")^2); degrees_freedomG = MODELG1$df.residual;
p_valueG = 1-pchisq(chi_squareG, degrees_freedomG)
paste0("Pearson goodness of fit = ", round(chi_squareG,2), ", df = ", degrees_freedomG, ", p-value = ", round(p_valueG,10))
```

```{r}
MODELG2 <- glm.nb(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + ArrestYear_IV + ArrestWeekday + ArrestMonth_IV + Race * CD_lin_spline, data=AnalysisDF, offset(log(Population)))
AIC_G2 <- AIC(MODELG2)
```

```{r}
LRTstat =2 *(logLik(MODELG2) -logLik(MODELG1))
df = 1
pval =1-pchisq(LRTstat, df)
paste0("LRT test statistic = ", round(LRTstat,2), ", df = ", df, ", p-value = ", round(pval,5))
```

```{r}
AIC_F2 <- AIC(MODELF2)

AIC_G2
```

```{r}
pander(summary(MODELG2))

# Summary of results

**Michael**: Code below (and object names) should be cleaned up to be more readable and relevant to its goals. 

```{r}

x1 = 1:5000
x2 = rep(1,5000)
x3 = 1:5000

y = exp(MODELG2$coefficients["CD_lin_spline"] * x1 +
          MODELG2$coefficients["RaceWhite"] * x2 +
                MODELG2$coefficients["RaceWhite:CD_lin_spline"] * x3)

white_df <- cbind(y, x1, x2, x3)

x2 = rep(0,5000)
x3 = rep(0,5000)

y = exp(MODELG2$coefficients["CD_lin_spline"] * x1 +
          MODELG2$coefficients["RaceWhite"] * x2 +
                MODELG2$coefficients["RaceWhite:CD_lin_spline"] * x3)

black_df <- cbind(y, x1, x2, x3)

model_df <- rbind(white_df, black_df)

model_df <- as.data.frame(model_df)

model_df$x2 <- as.factor(model_df$x2)

model_df$Race <- factor(model_df$x2, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("Black", "White"))

ggplot(model_df, aes(x=x1,y=y, color=Race))+
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Number of days since consent decree approval") +
  ylab("IRR") +
  ggtitle("Predicted IRR of Arrests", subtitle = "Reference group: black on day of consent decree approval") +
  theme_minimal()

3700/365
```

Other variables aside, the consent decree will close the disparities in arrest rates in approximately 10 years. 

**Michael**: This summary needs to be eabout two paragraphs long. The first should provide numerical results. A sentence or two should discuss the "Final Plot". THe second paragraph should make known limitations of our analysis. 

The IRR of ARRESTS (fix for below) after one year `r exp(MODELG2$coefficients["CD_lin_spline"]*365)` as compared to prior to the approval of the consent decree.

The IRR of being White `r exp(MODELG2$coefficients["RaceWhite"])`as compared to being Black. 

The IRR of the consent decree after one year among the White population `r exp(MODELG2$coefficients["RaceWhite:CD_lin_spline"]*365)`as compared to the Black population.

**Michael**: be clear about the data we have and the fact that we are assuming similar pace
