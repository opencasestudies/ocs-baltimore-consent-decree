# Motivation 

Following the death of Freddie Gray on April 12^th^, 2015, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake formally requested that an investigation of Baltimore's policing practices be taken by the Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ, after a yearlong investigation, found that the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) took part in unconstitutional policing practices. A consent decree between BPD and the DoJ, which mandates a series of restrictions on officers, amongst other things, was approved by a judge. *LRJ: can we add a date for the approval and a date for when it would go into effect?  Can we link to an article that summarizes the significance of Freddie Gray's death?*

The goal of the consent decree is to ensure that the Baltimore Police Department resolve the unconstitutional policing practices identified by the DoJ investigation. Although court enforceable, the practical impact of the consent decree is still unknown, largely because the scope of its various components and the underlying complexity of each of those components.

An excerpt from page 48 of [the DoJ's report](https://www.justice.gov/crt/file/883296/download) highlights the multiple infractions suspected of the Baltimore Police Department:

</div>

In this case study, we will look at patterns in arrests by BPD over time with the goal of assessing whether the consent decree had an impact on arrest patterns. 

The libraries used in this case study will be:

+ `tidyverse`, for data wranging and summarization, amongst other things, from a number of packages

+ `ggplot2`, for beautiful visualizations with ready data

+ `lubridate`, for converting time data into a form that can be used

+ continue to list them/describe them here

# What is the data? 

The analysis uses data from two sources:

+ [Open Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/)

+ [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)

**LRJ: need more here -- describe what data we will be getting from each of these sources**

# Data import {#data-import}

We start by loading the libraries we will need for this case study.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(MASS)
library(kableExtra)
```

**LRJ: I would separate the import of the two datasets.  First import and talk about the arrest data.  Then do the same with the population data after talking about how we need population data in order to work with arrest rates rather than counts of arrests.  In addition to talking about the dimension of each data frame, say a little bit (be brief) about what variables are in each.**

We import arrest data, as well as census data by race. These files were downloaded from [American FactFinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/guided_search.xhtml) and [Open Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Arrests/3i3v-ibrt).

**LRJ: we want to read in with the read_csv() function.  we may have to fix some variable names after doing this**
```{r}
BPD_Arrests_March1 <- read.csv("BPD_Arrests_March1.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(BPD_Arrests_March1)
```

![](View()_1.png)

```{r}
BaltimoreWhitePop <- read.csv("ACS_17_5YR_B01001A_W.csv", header=FALSE) #Update this to reflect download name of csv from actual source.
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(BaltimoreWhitePop)
```

![](View()_2.png)

```{r}
BaltimoreBlackPop <- read.csv("ACS_17_5YR_B01001B_BAA.csv", header=FALSE) #Update this to reflect download name of csv from actual source.
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(BaltimoreBlackPop)
```

![](View()_3.png)

We then look at the dimensions of each dataframe to get a handle on how large and complicated the dataframes are. 

The dataframe for arrests in Baltimore has `r dim(BPD_Arrests_March1)[1]` rows and `r dim(BPD_Arrests_March1)[2]` columns.

```{r}
dim(BPD_Arrests_March1)
```

The dataframe for the White population in Baltimore has `r dim(BaltimoreWhitePop)[1]` rows and `r dim(BaltimoreWhitePop)[2]` columns.

```{r}
dim(BaltimoreWhitePop)
```

The dataframe for the Black population in Baltimore has `r dim(BaltimoreBlackPop)[1]` rows and `r dim(BaltimoreBlackPop)[2]` columns.

```{r}
dim(BaltimoreBlackPop)
```

Now that we know a little bit about our dataframes, we can begin the process of transforming them for our analysis.

# Data wrangling 

Since three dataframes will be used for this analysis, it is important that we identify the role of each before continuing.

Simply put, we will be analyzing temporal trends in arrests while adjusting for the size of subpopulations. Our final dataframe should therefore have two components:

+ 1.0 Arrest data
    + 1.1 Open Baltimore Arrest Data
+ 2.0 Population data
    + 2.1 White population data
    + 2.2 Black population data

For our poisson regression, we need each of these components to be grouped in such a way that would allow them to be combined to make our final dataframe. 

Let us create a quick workflow.

**Workflow**

-----

We'll begin by making each of the three dataframes more practical to use. Then we'll combine the population datasets to make a population dataframe. Lastly, we'll create a final dataframe by grouping the arrest and population dataframes similarly and then combine the two.  

-----

**Making the arrest data more practical**

We'll begin with the arrest data.

![](View()_1.png)

Let us see what variables we are working with. 

```{r}
colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1)
```

**LRJ: give a brief description of each variable here**

We can get rid of the spatial data.

```{r}
SpatialData_no_coordinates <- c("ArrestLocation","IncidentLocation","District","Post","Neighborhood","Location.1","X2010.Census.Neighborhoods","X2010.Census.Wards.Precincts","Zip.Codes","Longitude","Latitude")
BPD_Arrests_March1 <- BPD_Arrests_March1[,!colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1) %in% SpatialData_no_coordinates]
colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1)
```

**LRJ: we want to do the above with the tidyverse, need to talk about MASS package ans select function**
```{r}
SpatialData_no_coordinates <- c("ArrestLocation","IncidentLocation","District","Post","Neighborhood","Location.1","X2010.Census.Neighborhoods","X2010.Census.Wards.Precincts","Zip.Codes","Longitude","Latitude")

BPD_Arrests_March1 <- BPD_Arrests_March1 %>%
  dplyr::select(-one_of(SpatialData_no_coordinates))

colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1)
```

We'll only be analyzing the basic characteristics of the arrestee, as well as the date and time in which the arrest was made. We will not consider the nature of the crime, the time of arrest, or arrest number. In doing so, we'll risk creating a small number problem Let us remove that data.

```{r}
NatureTimeArrest <- c("IncidentOffense","Charge","ChargeDescription","ArrestTime","Arrest")
BPD_Arrests_March1 <- BPD_Arrests_March1[,!colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1) %in% NatureTimeArrest]
colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1)
```

What type of data are we working with? Rather than use the `class()` function for each individual variable, we can use `lapply()` to apply the `class()` function to all of our columns. `lapply()` and the other functions in the `apply()` family (see ?apply, ?sapply, ?vapply) are great for applying functions across objects. 

**LRJ: Update this after using read_csv()**

```{r}
lapply(BPD_Arrests_March1[,1:length(colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1))],class)
```

It looks like our `ArrestDate` and coordinate (`Latitude` & `Longitude`) variables are not specified correctly.

Using `as.Date`, let's make sure R recognizes that the data is in month-day-year format.

```{r}
BPD_Arrests_March1$ArrestDate <- as.character(BPD_Arrests_March1$ArrestDate)
BPD_Arrests_March1$ArrestDate <- as.Date(BPD_Arrests_March1$ArrestDate, "%m/%d/%y")
```

Let's look at our dataframe again.

```{r}
head(BPD_Arrests_March1)
```

We'll group this final dataframe once we know the limitations of our population data. 

**Making the population data more practical**

We'll begin with the white population data.

![](View()_2.png)

Sometimes imported dataframes follow a rigorous codified format. This is more than often the case with very well maintained data. Codified dataframes often require a corresponding codebook.

We imported the dataframes without designating headers for this very reason. Census dataframes are often codified and contain a second set of headers for practical use. Although making the dataframe more functional is still possible without this step, importing the data in this way saves us a few steps.

Our arrest data has practical field names and no second set of headers. Our census data has two sets of headers. 

Our first glance at the census data (see [Data Import](#data-import)) revealed that the first rows of the census data we imported are codified while the second rows are practically named.

We will use the second rows of the census data as field names. This will allow different fields to be easily discernable from one another. 

This can be done simply by treating the second row as a list comprised of character class items. 

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop) <- as.character(BaltimoreWhitePop[2,])
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop[,1:5])
```

Our colnames are now a set of numbers. This is because *EXPLANATION*. *EXPLAIN WHY USING THESE COLNAMES WOULD BE A TERRIBLE IDEA* **ALSO: why are the colnames numbers to begin with?**

We cannot take an object that is a non-matrix-like object and the `colnames()` functions together. `colnames()` only recognizes matrix-like objects (see `?colnames()`.

We can transform the second row of the dataframe using the `unlist()` function, which produces a vector (a matrix-like object) from an object. 

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop) <- as.character(unlist(BaltimoreWhitePop[2,]))
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop[,1:5])
```

Now that we have appropriate headers, let us look at our dataframes.

```{r}
head(BaltimoreWhitePop[,1:5])
```

For each column, there is a field name, the original codified row, and the practical row we used to designate our field names. We can remove these now that we have appropriate field names

```{r}
BaltimoreWhitePop <- BaltimoreWhitePop[-(1:2),]
```

The census dataframes we imported are grouped by age group and gender. Each estimate has a corresponding margin of error. For this analysis, we will only be using the provided estimates. 

For efficiency, we should discard any data that will not be used in our analysis. We could manually remove one column at a time with multiple lines of code. This would take some time and and may involve some trial and error. 

Instead, we will use `substr` to take our character class field names and identify the fields we will need. 

This takes advantage of a programming concept known as [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression?oldformat=true). Simply put, a sequence of text in the data. 

`substr` searches for a distinct character string, a regular expressions, within a portion of the characters in a string. Below, we search for `Estimate` within the 1^st^ through 8^th^ characters in each field name and then save the columns that meet that criteria. We also save and rename the `Geography` column as good practice. Rownames are removed to avoid later confusion. 

```{r}
Geography <- BaltimoreWhitePop$Geography
BaltimoreWhitePop <- cbind(Geography,
        BaltimoreWhitePop[, substr(colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop),1,8)=="Estimate"])
rownames(BaltimoreWhitePop) <- c()
head(BaltimoreWhitePop[,1:5])
```

Let us look at our new column names.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop)
```

`"Estimate; "` is in nearly every column name in our new dataframe. Let's remove it to have an even more practical dataframe. To do this, we will use `str_remove` from the `stringr` package.

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop) <- str_remove(colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop),"Estimate; ")
```

Our new column names are much simpler.

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop)
```

Let's remove symbols, spaces, and `years` from our field names. The expression `[[:punct:]]` encompasses a wide range of symbols. `str_replace_all` differs from `str_replace` in that it is used to replace patterns for the entire string. A number of resources exist online showing the ways we can use regular expressions (click [here](http://web.mit.edu/hackl/www/lab/turkshop/slides/regex-cheatsheet.pdf) to see this great MIT resource).

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop), "[[:punct:]]", "")
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop), " ", "")
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop), "years", "")
```

Now our column names are practical and concise.

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreWhitePop)
```

We need to organize our dataframe to have a single column for age group and a single column gender. This data format is known as *long format* and is required to efficiently create data visualizations with the `ggplot` package. Doing this will also allow us to use more appropriate variables such as age group and gender as well as the specific age group-gender combinations the dataframe currently provides. 

Our dataframe is still a bit messy. It is currently in wide format has two variables of interest in nearly every column. We need to get our dataframe into long format and remove the variable pairings. To do this we will have to collapse the Population data gathered across columns into a single column current combinations and use this column to create a dataframe with age group and gender columns.

**We'll use the `melt()` function from the `reshape2` package to reorganize the data into long format. DELETE THIS**

*WHY THE WARNING?*

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop <- BaltimoreWhitePop %>% gather(key=AgeGroupGender, value=Population, -Geography)
head(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop)
```

Let us remove rows with from `variable` representing totals for each variable. This will simplify the summaries we create later with `dplyr`.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop <- molten.BaltimoreWhitePop[molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender!="Total",]
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop <- molten.BaltimoreWhitePop[molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender!="Male",]
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop <- molten.BaltimoreWhitePop[molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender!="Female",]
```

Now, let us create two empty columns, `AgeGroup` and `Gender`.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroup <- NA
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$Gender <- NA
head(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop)
```

Let us now fill our `AgeGroup` and `Gender` columns with information from our `variable` column. 

To do this we will we will identify patterns within strings and use those specific pattern to fill up our `AgeGroup` and `Gender` columns. This will involve using the `substr()` function along with an ifelse() statement for each of our columns. We will check whether our ifelse() functions worked by combining the `sum()` and `is.na()` functions.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender <- as.character(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender)
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$Gender <- ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender,1,4)=="Male","Male",
ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender,1,6)=="Female","Female",NA
       )
)
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroup <- ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender,1,4)=="Male",str_replace_all(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender,"Male",""),
                                            ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender,1,6)=="Female",str_replace_all(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender,"Female",""),NA)
                                            )
head(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop)
```

We can get rid of extraneous fields now that we have the fields we need.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$AgeGroupGender <- NULL
```

Recall leaving the `Geography` column as good practice. Leaving columns specific to a dataframe allow the dataframe to be easily identified from other dataframes after merging. We will be merging this dataframe to the other census dataframe to create a new dataframe with the population demographics we will be adjusting for in our analysis. To help identify which race this dataframe is specific to, we will add a new column, `Race`, with an appropriate factor.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop$Race <- as.factor("White")
```

Our `Population` variable should be last in our dataframe. `dplyr` could be helpful for this purpose. Let's select/subset the entire dataframe and conveniently reorder our columns. Notice that quotation marks are not necessary after piping with `dplyr`.

```{r}
molten.BaltimoreWhitePop <- molten.BaltimoreWhitePop %>% arrange(Geography,AgeGroup,Gender,Race,Population)
head(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop)
```

Let us take a quick look at our progress thus far.

```{r}
head(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop)
```

If our two dataframes are identically formatted, the data wrangling steps we have made up to this point can be repeated to yield a similar dataframe without error.

```{r}
colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop) <- as.character(unlist(BaltimoreBlackPop[2,]))
BaltimoreBlackPop <- BaltimoreBlackPop[-(1:2),]
Geography <- BaltimoreBlackPop$Geography
BaltimoreBlackPop <- cbind(Geography,
        BaltimoreBlackPop[, substr(colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop),1,8)=="Estimate"])
rownames(BaltimoreBlackPop) <- c()
colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop) <- str_remove(colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop),"Estimate; ")
colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop), "[[:punct:]]", "")
colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop), " ", "")
colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop) <- str_replace_all(colnames(BaltimoreBlackPop), "years", "")
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop <- BaltimoreBlackPop %>% gather(key=AgeGroupGender, value=Population, -Geography)
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop <- molten.BaltimoreBlackPop[molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender!="Total",]
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop <- molten.BaltimoreBlackPop[molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender!="Male",]
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop <- molten.BaltimoreBlackPop[molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender!="Female",]
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroup <- NA
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$Gender <- NA
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender <- as.character(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender)
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$Gender <- ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender,1,4)=="Male","Male",
ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender,1,6)=="Female","Female",NA
       )
)
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroup <- ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender,1,4)=="Male",str_replace_all(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender,"Male",""),
                                            ifelse(substr(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender,1,6)=="Female",str_replace_all(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender,"Female",""),NA)
                                            )
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$AgeGroupGender <- NULL
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop$Race <- as.factor("Black")
molten.BaltimoreBlackPop <- molten.BaltimoreBlackPop %>% 
arrange(Geography,AgeGroup,Gender,Race,Population)
head(molten.BaltimoreBlackPop)
```

As you can see, after repeating the same data wrangling steps, the second dataframe is similarly formatted. 

Let's combine demographic data from the two to create a dataframe from which to base our offset for our regression analysis. We will use `bind_rows` from the `dplyr` package. 

```{r}
demographics <- bind_rows(molten.BaltimoreWhitePop,molten.BaltimoreBlackPop)
head(demographics)
```

Oops! We did some serious wrangling and have not checked our column classes. Let's save some time and apply the `class()` function to all columns of our new dataframe to see whether we inadvertently made some changes along the way that can complicate further wrangling. 

```{r}
lapply(demographics[,1:length(colnames(demographics))],class)
```

Although we set our `Race` columns as factors prior to using `bind_rows()`, the `Race`column in the new dataframe is a character class. Furthermore, our `Gender`, `AgeGroup`, and `Population` columns are incorrectly specificed as `character` classes.

We are about to use `dplyr` and `ggplot` for exploratory data analysis. Now would be a good time to fix this. 

```{r}
demographics[,c("Gender","AgeGroup","Race")] <- lapply(demographics[,c("Gender","AgeGroup","Race")],as.factor)

demographics$Population <- as.numeric(demographics$Population)
lapply(demographics[,1:length(colnames(demographics))],class)
```

The `head()` function only returns several of the uppermost rows, meaning that we are not be able to assess what happened to our rows after we used the `bind_rows()` function. We loaded the `dplyr` package for data summarization. If our dataframes were bound and specified correctly, we should be able to accurately recreate summaries of the data. Let's use the `group_by`,`summarise()`, and `mutate()` functions to do just that. In 2017, Baltimore was roughly 30% White and 63% Black (see the [US Census Estimates for Baltimore City](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_5YR_B02001&prodType=table)). If we bound and specified our dataframes correctly, we should be able to generate similar figures.

In 2017, about 93% of Baltimore was either White or Black. Let us use that information and compare it to the [US Census Estimates for Baltimore City](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_5YR_B02001&prodType=table).

```{r}
TotalPopulationMultiplier <- (100/93)
demographics %>%
  group_by(Race) %>% summarise(n = sum(Population)) %>% mutate(Percent = n/(sum(n)*(TotalPopulationMultiplier)))
```

Our figures are consistent with those by the census. 

We need to group the arrest and population data similarly so that we can merge information from both dataframes into a single dataframe for analysis. 

To group our dataframes properly, we need to know the ways they are similar and the ways they are different. 

```{r}
colnames(demographics)
colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1)
```

Our dataframes are similar in the following ways: 

+ Both have information by sex or gender. **Insert disclaimer about police department using sex and not gender**

+ Both have information by race. 

+ Both have information pertaining to age. 

Our dataframes are different in the following ways: 

+ Our demographic data defines age by categorical groups and not in discrete values (as in the arrest data). 

+ Our demographic data does not have a temporal variable as does the arrest data.

+ Our demographic data has information for the Black and White population in Baltimore, whereas our arrest data includes arrests of people of other races. 

Before grouping, we need to limit our analysis to the Black and White population. We also need to define age similarly for both dataframes. We need to do this while preserving the temporal information provided by the arrest data. 

Let us remove rows from the arrest data that are outside the scope of this analysis. 

```{r}
summary(BPD_Arrests_March1$Race)
```

Let us ensure also that our labels are clear.

```{r}
BPD_Arrests_March1 <- BPD_Arrests_March1[BPD_Arrests_March1$Race=="B"|BPD_Arrests_March1$Race=="W",]
BPD_Arrests_March1$Race <- factor(BPD_Arrests_March1$Race, levels = c("B","W"),labels = c("Black","White"))
summary(BPD_Arrests_March1$Race)
```

Now let's recode the age information provided by the arrest data by the age groups used in the demographic data. 

```{r}
levels(demographics$AgeGroup)
demographics <- demographics[demographics$AgeGroup!="Under5",]
demographics <- demographics[demographics$AgeGroup!="5to9",]
demographics <- demographics[demographics$AgeGroup!="10to14",]
demographics <- demographics[demographics$AgeGroup!="15to17",]
demographics$AgeGroup <- factor(demographics$AgeGroup, levels = c("18and19",
                                                "20to24",
                                                "25to29",
                                                "30to34",
                                                "35to44",
                                                "45to54",
                                                "55to64",
                                                "65to74",
                                                "75to84",
                                                "85andover"),
                       ordered = TRUE)
lapply(demographics, levels)
```

How do our levels compare?

```{r}
lapply(BPD_Arrests_March1, levels)
```

It looks like the `Sex` variable levels in the arrest data are inconsistent with the `Gender` variable levels in our demographic data.

It's important that data be as clear as possible. Let us recode the `Sex` variable in the arrest to accomplish this. 

```{r}
BPD_Arrests_March1$Sex <- factor(BPD_Arrests_March1$Sex, levels = c("F","M"), labels = c("Female", "Male"))
```

```{r}
BPD_Arrests_March1 <- BPD_Arrests_March1[BPD_Arrests_March1$Age>=18,]
BPD_Arrests_March1 <- BPD_Arrests_March1[is.na(BPD_Arrests_March1$Age)==FALSE,]
BPD_Arrests_March1$Age <- cut(BPD_Arrests_March1$Age, breaks=c(17,19,24,29,34,44,54,64,74,84,Inf),labels=levels(demographics$AgeGroup),ordered_result = TRUE, include.lowest = FALSE)
summary(BPD_Arrests_March1$Age)
```

Let's change the names of the `Age` and `Sex` variables.

```{r}
colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1)[colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1)=="Age"] <- c("AgeGroup")
colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1)[colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1)=="Sex"] <- c("Gender")
colnames(BPD_Arrests_March1)
```

Now we can group and combine the data.

```{r}
ArrestData <- BPD_Arrests_March1 %>% group_by_all() %>% summarise(Arrests=n())
DemographicData <- demographics %>% group_by_at(vars(Gender,AgeGroup,Race,Population))
AnalysisDF <- merge(ArrestData, DemographicData, by=c("Gender","AgeGroup","Race"))
AnalysisDF$Month <- month(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate)
AnalysisDF$Year <- year(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate)
head(AnalysisDF)
```

Because we'll be analyzing temporal data, we should convert our temporal data into various units for analysis. 

```{r}
AnalysisDF <- AnalysisDF %>% mutate(ArrestDay = floor_date(ArrestDate,"day"),
                                    ArrestWeekday=weekdays(ArrestDate),
                                    ArrestWeek=floor_date(ArrestDate,"week"),
                                    ArrestMonth=floor_date(ArrestDate,"month"),
                          ArrestQuarter=floor_date(ArrestDate,"quarter"),
                          ArrestSeason=floor_date(ArrestDate,"season"),
                          ArrestYear=floor_date(ArrestDate,"year"))

AnalysisDF$ArrestWeekday <- factor(AnalysisDF$ArrestWeekday, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"),labels = c("Sun","Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat"), ordered = TRUE)

head(AnalysisDF)
```

Let's explore the data! 

# Exploratory data analysis

Let's see if any related historical events coincided with changes in arrests.

Our data is currently grouped by date in `%m/%d/%y` format. Given the number of arrests in our dataset, it's likely that these arrests cover most if not all days in between 2014 and 2018. For visualization purposes, this may offer too high of a resolution to see any patterns that may exist. 

**Visit this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18091721/align-geom-text-to-a-geom-vline-in-ggplot2) document to learn how to implement this more elegantly**

**alpha does not work on geom_point**

```{r, message=FALSE}
AnalysisDF %>% group_by(week=ArrestWeek) %>% mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = week, y=n))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red")+
  xlab('')+
  ylab('Arrests')+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=as.Date("2014-08-09"),color="1_Death of Michael Brown"), linetype="solid",size=3)+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=as.Date("2015-04-12"),color="2_Death of Freddie Gray"), linetype="solid",size=3)+ 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=as.Date("2015-05-06"),color="3_DoJ Investigation Requested by Major Blake"), linetype="solid",size=3) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=as.Date("2016-08-10"),color="4_DoJ Announces Findings of Investigation"), linetype="solid",size=3) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=as.Date("2017-04-07"),color="5_Consent Decree Approved"), linetype="solid",size=3)+
  scale_color_manual(name="Event",values=c("red","green","blue","orange","purple"),labels=c("Death of Michael Brown","Death of Freddie Gray","DoJ Investigation Requested by Major Blake","DoJ Announces Findings of Investigation","Consent Decree Approved"))+
  ggtitle("Arrests/Week in Baltimore")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "vertical")
```

The deaths of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray both appear to immediately precede sharp declines in the number of arrests. The DoJ's announcement of its findings of its investigation also precedes a decline in the number of arrests. 

`geom_smooth` can often oversmooth our data, reducing its variance, meaning we may not be able to see any small scale variation that could be relevant for our analysis. 

We can use `gridExtra` to place all these plots in a single plot. This makes comparisons a bit easier. 

2019 has incomplete data, let's exclude it for now. 

```{r}
day <- AnalysisDF %>% filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>% group_by(day=ArrestDay) %>% mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=day, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="red")
```

```{r}
week <- AnalysisDF %>% filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>% group_by(week=ArrestWeek) %>% mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=week, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="purple")
```

```{r}
month <- AnalysisDF %>% filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>% group_by(month=ArrestMonth) %>% mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=month, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="green")
```

```{r}
quarter <- AnalysisDF %>% filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>% group_by(quarter=ArrestQuarter) %>% mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=quarter, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="pink")
```

```{r}
season <- AnalysisDF %>% filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>% group_by(season=ArrestQuarter) %>% mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=season, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="blue")
```

```{r}
year <- AnalysisDF %>% filter(!(Year %in% 2019)) %>% group_by(year=ArrestYear) %>% mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=n))+
  geom_line(color="orange")
```

```{r}
grid.arrange(day,week,month,quarter,season,year,nrow=3,ncol=2,top="Plot 2")
```

It looks like using month units works well for observing large and small scale variation. We will use unit to explore the data some more temporally. Note that our decision to use this unit is strictly for vizualization purposes and does not necessarily mean that any specific pattern exists for statistical purposes. 

```{r}
AnalysisDF %>% group_by(ArrestMonth,Race,Gender,AgeGroup) %>% mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=ArrestMonth, y=n,color=AgeGroup))+
  geom_line(size=0.25,alpha=1)+
  facet_grid(Gender~Race)
```

Our vizualizations for representing Black or male arrests appear to highlight clear differences in arrest counts by age group. Let us now use rates.

```{r}
AnalysisDF %>% group_by(ArrestMonth,Race,Gender,AgeGroup) %>% mutate(r=sum(Arrests)/sum(Population)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=ArrestMonth, y=r,color=AgeGroup))+
  geom_line(size=0.25,alpha=1)+
  facet_grid(Gender~Race)
```

Note the two signals in one of the younger age groups for white females. This could either be indicative of short term variation we should be aware of of a small number problem. Recall that the small number problem occurs when the numerator for rates is small and thus small changes in its count result in very large changes in a rate. We could check to see if these signals are a result of a small number problem. 

```{r}
SignalDF <- AnalysisDF %>% filter(Year==2015:2017,Gender=="Female",Race=="White",AgeGroup=="20to24") %>% group_by(ArrestMonth,Race,Gender,AgeGroup) %>% mutate(r=Arrests/Population) %>% filter(r>=5e-04) %>% pull(Arrests)

unstable_arrest_counts <- unique(SignalDF) 
length(unstable_arrest_counts)

theoretical_arrests<- 1:10
theoretical_rate <- seq(1,10,by=1)/6744
theoretical_rate_by_arrests <- as.data.frame(cbind(theoretical_arrests,theoretical_rate))
theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate_ratio <- lag(theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate)/theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate
theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate_ratio_inverse <- 1/(lag(theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate)/theoretical_rate_by_arrests$theoretical_rate)

#gather so that two lines can be made
theoretical_rate_by_arrests <- theoretical_rate_by_arrests %>% gather(key=Type,value=Value,theoretical_rate_ratio,theoretical_rate_ratio_inverse,-theoretical_rate,-theoretical_arrests)

theoretical_rate_by_arrests <- theoretical_rate_by_arrests[complete.cases(theoretical_rate_by_arrests)==TRUE,]

ggplot(theoretical_rate_by_arrests,aes(x=theoretical_arrests, y=Value,color=Type))+
  geom_point(size=1)+
  geom_line(size=1)+
  geom_vline(xintercept=unstable_arrest_counts[1],color="black")
```

As you can see, the arrest counts are very low. It is likely that the signal found in the plot we made was just a result of unstable rates.

Weekdays cannot be linearly plotted, meaning we need to examine arrest counts by weekdays separately.

```{r}
AnalysisDF %>% group_by(ArrestWeekday,Race,Gender,AgeGroup) %>% mutate(n=sum(Arrests)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=ArrestWeekday,y=n,fill=AgeGroup))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position = 'dodge')+
  facet_grid(Gender~Race)
```

```{r}
AnalysisDF %>% group_by(ArrestWeekday,Race,Gender,AgeGroup) %>% mutate(r=Arrests/Population) %>% ggplot(aes(x=ArrestWeekday,y=r,fill=AgeGroup))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position = 'dodge')+
  facet_grid(Gender~Race)
```

Let's check our assumptions about the distribution of the outcome, arrest counts.

```{r}
arrests_n_per_day_poisson <- AnalysisDF %>% group_by(ArrestDay) %>% summarise(n = sum(Arrests))

ggplot(data = arrests_n_per_day_poisson,
       mapping = aes(sample = n)) + stat_qq(distribution = stats::qpois, dparams = list(lambda = mean(arrests_n_per_day_poisson$n)),size=2, alpha=0.1) + 
  geom_line(data = data.frame(x = 10:173, n = 10:173), aes(x = x, y = n), colour = "red",alpha = 1,size=2) + ggtitle("QQ Plot, Poisson Distribution") + xlab("Theoretical Arrest Count") + ylab("Sample Arrest Count")
```

It looks like our counts per day do not fit the Poisson distribution

```{r}
arrests_n_per_day_nb <- AnalysisDF %>% group_by(ArrestDay) %>% summarise(n = sum(Arrests))

ggplot(data = arrests_n_per_day_nb,
       mapping = aes(sample = n)) + stat_qq(distribution = stats::qnbinom, dparams = list(mu = mean(arrests_n_per_day_nb$n), size=length(arrests_n_per_day_nb$n)),size=2, alpha=0.1) + 
  geom_line(data = data.frame(x = 10:173, n = 10:173), aes(x = x, y = n), colour = "red",alpha = 1,size=2) + ggtitle("QQ Plot, Negative Binomal Distribution") + xlab("Theoretical Arrest Count") + ylab("Sample Arrest Count")
```

# Data analysis 

```{r}
colnames(AnalysisDF)
```

Let's create the linear spline for the approval of the consent decree.

**DOES THIS METHOD WORK?** [LINK TO METHOD](https://faculty.washington.edu/heagerty/Courses/b571/homework/spline-tutorial.q)

**WHY IS AIC NOT PRINTING PROPERLY?**
```{r}
AnalysisDF$CD_lin_spline <- (AnalysisDF$ArrestDate - ymd("2017-04-07"))
AnalysisDF$CD_lin_spline[AnalysisDF$CD_lin_spline<0] <- 0
```

How does our temporal data look like? 

Our temporal data is currently a date class, meaning R will recognize it as numeric. This will pose problems, as our model will resultantly try to fit a linear model and thus not account for trends within a certain time unit but attempt to explain an average change per time unit. In order to account for trends, we must create indicator variables for our temporal data. 

`lubridate` has excellent functions for this. A good rule of thumb for properly creating indicator variables from date classes is that the output of a function that extracts values from date classes has to be ready for interpretable categorization with `as.factor`. In other words, the unique values produced during extraction should correspond to the intended categories. 

```{r}
AnalysisDF$ArrestWeek_IV <- as.factor(week(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate))
AnalysisDF$ArrestMonth_IV <- as.factor(month(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate))
AnalysisDF$ArrestQuarter_IV <- as.factor(quarter(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate))
AnalysisDF$ArrestYear_IV <- as.factor(year(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate))
```

Seasons also need to be generated. A good thing to know is that winter starts in December. With that information and `floor_date`, which rounds date class data down to the lowest boundary, we can assign seasons to our temporal data.

```{r}
AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV <- floor_date(AnalysisDF$ArrestDate, "season")
AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV <- months(AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV)
AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV <- as.factor(AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV)
AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV <- factor(AnalysisDF$ArrestSeason_IV, levels = c("March", "June", "September","December"), labels = c("Spring","Summer","Fall","Winter"))
```

```{r}
colnames(AnalysisDF)
```

```{r}
MODELA1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

chi_squareA = sum(residuals(MODELA1, type = "pearson")^2); degrees_freedomA = MODELA1$df.residual;
p_valueA = 1-pchisq(chi_squareA, degrees_freedomA)
paste0("Pearson goodness of fit = ", round(chi_squareA,2), ", df = ", degrees_freedomA, ", p-value = ", round(p_valueA,10))

MODELA2 <- glm.nb(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline, data=AnalysisDF, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_A <- AIC(MODELA2)
```

```{r}
MODELB1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

chi_squareB = sum(residuals(MODELB1, type = "pearson")^2); degrees_freedomB = MODELB1$df.residual;
p_valueB = 1-pchisq(chi_squareB, degrees_freedomB)
paste0("Pearson goodness of fit = ", round(chi_squareB,2), ", df = ", degrees_freedomB, ", p-value = ", round(p_valueB,10))

MODELB2 <- glm.nb(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday, data=AnalysisDF, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_B <- AIC(MODELB2)
```

```{r}
MODELC1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday + ArrestQuarter_IV, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

chi_squareC = sum(residuals(MODELC1, type = "pearson")^2); degrees_freedomC = MODELC1$df.residual;
p_valueC = 1-pchisq(chi_squareC, degrees_freedomC)
paste0("Pearson goodness of fit = ", round(chi_squareC,2), ", df = ", degrees_freedomC, ", p-value = ", round(p_valueC,10))

MODELC2 <- glm.nb(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday + ArrestQuarter_IV, data=AnalysisDF, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_C <- AIC(MODELC2)
```

```{r}
MODELD1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday + ArrestSeason_IV, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

chi_squareD = sum(residuals(MODELD1, type = "pearson")^2); degrees_freedomD = MODELD1$df.residual;
p_valueD = 1-pchisq(chi_squareD, degrees_freedomD)
paste0("Pearson goodness of fit = ", round(chi_squareD,2), ", df = ", degrees_freedomD, ", p-value = ", round(p_valueD,10))

MODELD2 <- glm.nb(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday + ArrestSeason_IV, data=AnalysisDF, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_D <- AIC(MODELD2)
```

It appears that our quarter indicator variable better explains within year variation than does that season indicator variable.

```{r}
MODELE1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday + ArrestMonth_IV, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

chi_squareE = sum(residuals(MODELE1, type = "pearson")^2); degrees_freedomE = MODELE1$df.residual;
p_valueE = 1-pchisq(chi_squareE, degrees_freedomE)
paste0("Pearson goodness of fit = ", round(chi_squareE,2), ", df = ", degrees_freedomE, ", p-value = ", round(p_valueE,10))

MODELE2 <- glm.nb(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + Race + ArrestDay + CD_lin_spline + ArrestWeekday + ArrestMonth_IV, data=AnalysisDF, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_E <- AIC(MODELE2)
```

It appears that our month indicator variable explains within year variation moreso than our quarter indicator variable.

We will create one last model that will determine whether there is an interaction between our consent decree and race indicator variables.

```{r}
MODELF1 <- glm(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + ArrestDay + ArrestWeekday + ArrestMonth_IV + Race * CD_lin_spline, data=AnalysisDF, family=poisson, offset(log(Population)))

chi_squareF = sum(residuals(MODELF1, type = "pearson")^2); degrees_freedomF = MODELF1$df.residual;
p_valueF = 1-pchisq(chi_squareF, degrees_freedomF)
paste0("Pearson goodness of fit = ", round(chi_squareF,2), ", df = ", degrees_freedomF, ", p-value = ", round(p_valueF,10))

MODELF2 <- glm.nb(Arrests ~ Gender + AgeGroup + ArrestDay + ArrestWeekday + ArrestMonth_IV + Race * CD_lin_spline, data=AnalysisDF, offset(log(Population)))

AIC_F <- AIC(MODELF2)
```

It seems that we have ran out of covariates to explore. 

Let us review the AIC values for our models. 

```{r}
model_names <- c("A",
                 "B",
                 "C",
                 "D",
                 "E",
                 "F")

model_AICs <- c(AIC_A,
                AIC_B,
                AIC_C,
                AIC_D,
                AIC_E,
                AIC_F)

model_AICs <- round(model_AICs, 0)

model_AICs_table<- cbind(model_names, model_AICs)

colnames(model_AICs_table) <- c("Model","AIC")

kable(model_AICs_table) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("bordered","condensed")) %>%
  row_spec(6, bold = T, color = "white", background = "black")
```

`r round((exp(summary(MODELF2)$coefficients["RaceWhite:CD_lin_spline","Estimate"])*1000)-1000,2)` more white people were arrested per 1000 arrests made. 

# Summary of results

The consent decree was followed by an increase in (approximately `r round((exp(summary(MODELF2)$coefficients["CD_lin_spline","Estimate"])*1000)-1000,2)` more arrests per 1000 arrests made prior to the consent decree. Despite this increase, people who were Black were less susceptible to arrest following the implementation of the consent decree. Following the implementation of the consent decree, there were approximately *Y* less arrests of Black people per 1000 arrests made prior to its implementation. 

Ultimately, the consent decree led to an overall increase in arrest rates for Black and White people in Baltimore. The consent decree did, however, reduce the disparities in arrest rates between Black and White people in Baltimore.
